#### Dockerized-three-tier-app

### A demonstration of containerizing a three-tier logical application architecture using Node.js and orchestrating services with Docker Compose.

#### Prerequisites
### You must have the following tools installed on your machine:

## -Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)

## -Docker Compose
