# ðŸš€ Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)

### This repository utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the entire build, security scanning, and publishing process for all four Dockerized services. This ensures that every time code is merged into the main branch, the deployed images are up-to-date and secure.

## Workflow: Scan, Build, & Publish to Docker Hub





|Component | Image Name |
| --- | --- |
| `Backend ` | dev126712/dockerized-three-tier-app-backend:latest |
| `Frontend` | dev126712/dockerized-three-tier-app-frontend:latest |
| `Database` | dev126712/dockerized-three-tier-app-database:latest |
| `Proxy` | dev126712/dockerized-three-tier-app-proxy:latest |




    

# ðŸ“‹ Automation Steps

### The workflow runs on every push to the main branch, but only if changes are detected in one of the service Dockerfiles or the GitHub workflow configuration itself.





| Step | Purpose | Security Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1. Build the Docker Images ` | Compiles and packages the application code into the four distinct Docker images, tagging them with :latest locally. | Ensures the resulting artifacts are ready for the security check. |
| ` 2. Install Trivy` | Installs Trivy, a comprehensive open-source vulnerability scanner, onto the GitHub Actions runner environment. | Sets up the necessary tool for performing deep security analysis. |
| `3. Run Trivy Vulnerability Scanner` | Scans all four locally built Docker images. The scan checks the operating system packages and application dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. | Quality Gate: This is the core security step. It specifically checks for CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities to ensure all published images meet a minimum security standard. |
| `4. Push Image to Docker Hub` | If the security scan passes, the workflow logs into Docker Hub using the stored secret (DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN) and pushes the newly built and validated images to the designated repository. | Deployment: Ensures only tested and scanned images are made publicly available for deployment. |

### This automated process guarantees that developers can focus on writing code while the pipeline handles the necessary packaging, security checks, and distribution tasks.
